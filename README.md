# data-for-tests
> Saves datasets used in test suites into a central location, so we don't need to save them alongside our code. 

## Why does this repo exist?
Saving datasets into a repo is problematic. It looks like you wrote crazy amounts of code, when all you did is save a .csv file. It also makes it more difficult to download, since you are now forcing all your users to download these many-megabyte files whenever they want access to your code. 

This repo is designed to be used with `data-formatter` and `machine-js`, holding the data used by their test suites.
